# CHORE NOTIFIER

For some reason if a computer tells me to do my chores I will do them.

Little lambda function that generates a chore list and texts it to us every day. It's in python b/c I don't know python well and it seemed like a good idea to learn more. It was written on paternity leave in an hour or two so the code is bad. BUT, our floor is clean.
